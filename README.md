# bestgames.ini

Inspired "rankings.ini" files, this .ini file is my personal ranking of the arcade games that MAME; to create the file is examined the whole set, but excluding:

* Clones
* BIOS
* Devices
* Mechanical
* Medal Game
* Not Working
* Casino
* Mahjong
* Home Systems

The list of supported games is generated by this research: http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/?search=mame&clone=0&tipo_gioco=parent&driver_status=workingimperfect
Remember that it is personal assessments, which are affected by many factors. These are not general acceptance charts.
If there are marks that you feel obviously wrong, send me an email (progettosnaps@gmail.com) indicating the name of the game (according to the MAME description) and the vote that you would like him to be assigned. I will consider all your mails.
